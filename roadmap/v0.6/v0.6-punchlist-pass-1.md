# v0.6.0 – Punchlist (Inhabitation Pass #1)

**Date:** 2026-01-01  
**Mode:** Designer-as-User (Student + Teacher)  
**Intent:** Identify friction, confusion, and missing affordances  
**Non-Goals:** No new features, no refactors, no new analytics

## How to Read This List

Each item is tagged as one of:
- 🐞 **Bug** – something is broken or inconsistent
- 🧭 **Affordance Gap** – something is missing or unclear
- 🪟 **Visibility Issue** – data exists but isn’t surfaced well
- 🧪 **Question (Defer)** – worth thinking about, not fixing yet

Only 🐞 and 🧭 items should be fixed in the next pass.

---

## GLOBAL

### Notifications & System Awareness
- 🧭 Sidebar items should show badge counts  
  *e.g., pending sources, students needing attention*
- 🧭 Is there a canonical place for users to see **all notifications**?

---

## STUDENT EXPERIENCE

### Sidebar & Navigation
- 🧪 Should locked capabilities appear in the sidebar, or only once unlocked?

---

### Threads
- 🐞 From inside a Thread, I cannot add additional notes
- 🧭 Thread notes do not show original author — is authorship intentionally hidden?

---

### Thinking Profile (Student Dashboard)
- 🧭 Should the sidebar item and route be renamed to `/thinking-profile`?
- 🧭 Production Rhythm:
  - Should days be clickable or hoverable to reveal notes?
- 🧪 Are there additional *visual* (not analytic) affordances we want here?

---

### Class Feed
- 🧭 Cards do not display tags — is that intentional?
- 🧭 Should filtering/sorting be available beyond search?
- 🐞 Unclear purpose of the “Students” section in the Class Feed

---

### Graph
- 🧭 Tag-based search/filtering not available
- 🧭 Additional search/filter affordances may be needed

---

### Advanced Breadcrumbs
- 🧭 I do not understand where this feature manifests or how to notice it

---

### My Notes
- 🐞 Clicking “New Note” routes to My Notes but does not show inbox/permanent notes until refresh

---

## ADMIN EXPERIENCE

### Sidebar
- 🧭 “New Note” button unnecessary in Admin sidebar

---

### Admin Dashboard
- 🧭 Student directory needs filtering:
  - by section
  - by teacher
  - by “needs attention”
- 🧪 Desire for richer pattern views (e.g., spider graphs) — defer
- 🧭 Need visibility into incoming/outgoing mentions
- 🧪 General desire for “more data” — needs careful scope control

---

### Sources
- 🧭 Missing “Other” source type
- 🧭 Need a description field for sources
- 🧭 Clarify what triggers “pending source” status
- 🧭 Sources list needs:
  - sorting
  - filtering
  - counts of linked notes
- 🧭 Clicking a source should open a sidepanel
- 🐞 Sidebar → Sources should default to approved list, with pending accessible

---

### Reflections
- 🧭 Reflection initiation needs filtering:
  - by section
  - by teacher
