# v0.6 Feature Spec — Student-Created Sources

## Purpose

Allow students to add new sources beyond teacher-assigned texts,
while maintaining shared reference integrity.

---

## Student Experience

- Create new sources when needed
- Duplicate detection during creation
- Required bibliographic fields (MLA-aligned)
- Once created, sources are shared class-wide

---

## Teacher Controls

- Teachers can edit or remove any source
- Review queue for newly added sources
- Flag duplicates or errors

---

## Integration

- Sources appear in [[link]] autocomplete
- Displayed as distinct nodes in graph (toggleable)
- Source usage visible in Teacher Dashboard

---

## Design Constraints

- No points awarded for creating sources
- Sources do not validate correctness
- Sources function as anchors, not authorities
