# Codex Machina v0.6 — Classroom Expansion & Writing Integration

**Goal:**  
By the end of v0.6, Codex Machina is ready to be promoted to **v1.0** and used live
through an entire semester without reintroducing ranking, gamification,
or AI authority creep.

v0.6 extends Codex Machina **only where it deepens thinking or supports writing**.
It does not revisit core mechanics already stabilized in v0.5.10.

---

## Guiding Principle

v0.6 adds **affordances**, not incentives.

Every new feature must:
- preserve student provisionality
- reinforce writing-as-thinking
- support teacher judgment without automating it
- remain interpretable without being gameable

---

## v0.6 Scope (Confirmed)

### HIGH PRIORITY
1. Outline Assembly Tool
2. Reflections System (Metacognitive Interviews)
3. Student-Created Sources (with moderation)

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
4. Tags System (Supplemental organization only)

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

- No leaderboards
- No student-facing points or grades
- No unlock logic changes
- No AI writing assistance
- No quota enforcement UI
- No competitive analytics

---

## Definition of v1.0 Readiness

Codex Machina is ready for v1.0 when:
- teachers trust it during daily use
- students do not fear or optimize it
- writing flows naturally from notes into formal work
- the system teaches the same lesson the course teaches
