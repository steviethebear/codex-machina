# Global Roadmap

_NOTE: This document defines the long-term direction, constraints, and staging
of Codex Machina. It is intentionally philosophical as well as technical.
Feature-level detail lives in version-specific roadmap files._

---

## v0.5 — Epistemic Foundation (Complete)

**Codex Machina v0.5 defines what this system is.  
All future work must preserve this stance.**

By the end of v0.5, Codex Machina establishes its core commitments:

- Writing as thinking, not preparation
- Continuity of thought over frequency of activity
- Unlocks as perceptual affordances, not rewards
- No student-facing ranking, XP, or competition
- AI as diagnostic and structural, not authoritative
- Teacher judgment as primary and overridable
- Notes as permanent intellectual traces, not drafts
- Structure emerging through use, not enforcement

v0.5 is **theoretically and philosophically complete**.  
It has not yet been tested with students.

Future versions extend capability and test assumptions;
they do not revisit the core stance established here.

---

## v0.6 — Classroom Preparation & Capability Expansion (Planned)

**Purpose:**  
Prepare Codex Machina for first live classroom use by expanding writing-related
capabilities, refining teacher workflows, and explicitly defining all unlockables.

v0.6 is where the system becomes **classroom-ready**, but not yet classroom-proven.

---

### Defining Unlockables (Critical v0.6 Task)

By the end of v0.6:

- **All unlockable features must be explicitly defined**, including:
  - Thinking Profile
  - Graph View
  - Advanced Breadcrumbs
  - Threads
  - Tags (if unlockable)
  - Any additional affordances introduced in v0.6
- Each unlockable must have:
  - a clear purpose (what new way of seeing/working it enables)
  - a conceptual unlock rationale (what kind of intellectual readiness it assumes)
- Unlocks must remain:
  - opaque to students
  - based on continuity and structure, not performance
  - teacher-overridable

No new unlock logic should be invented after v0.6 without revisiting this document.

---

### Confirmed Areas of Expansion

- **Threads**
  - Weaving permanent notes into lines of thought
  - Arrangement as thinking
  - Pre-writing without drafting pressure

- **Reflections**
  - Metacognitive interviews
  - AI prompts reflection but does not evaluate
  - Used for understanding, not grading

- **Student-Created Sources**
  - Shared reference anchors
  - Duplicate detection and teacher moderation
  - Responsible expansion beyond assigned texts

- **Tags (Supplemental)**
  - Optional organizational layer
  - Secondary to [[linking]]
  - No points, no unlock impact unless explicitly decided

---

### Explicit Constraints (Still in Force)

- No leaderboards
- No student-facing grades or point totals
- No AI writing assistance
- No quota enforcement UI
- No unlocks framed as achievement or progress

v0.6 should feel like **new rooms added to a stable house**, not a remodel.

---

## v1.0 — Initial Live Classroom Use

**Definition of “1.0”**

Codex Machina reaches v1.0 when it is:
- deployed with real students
- used as part of normal classroom practice
- observed under authentic conditions of confusion, uneven engagement,
  misunderstanding, and discovery

v1.0 is **not a claim of perfection**.
It is the beginning of real-world testing.

---

### v1.0 Success Criteria

Codex Machina is successful at v1.0 if:

- Students can use it without fear or performance anxiety
- Teachers can interpret system signals without deferring judgment
- Quiet, thoughtful students are not penalized
- Overproduction does not dominate visibility
- Unlocks feel like new affordances, not goals
- Misuse or misunderstanding reveals itself quickly and transparently

Unexpected behavior is expected at v1.0.
The goal is learnability, not polish.

---

## v1.x — Classroom Iteration & Maturation

Post–v1.0 development responds to **actual classroom use**, not speculation.

Potential areas (not commitments):

- Refinement of unlock timing or sequencing
- Adjustments to teacher dashboards based on real workflows
- Writing-related tools (drafts, revision spaces)
- Export and portfolio tools
- Accessibility enhancements
- Mobile optimizations
- Advanced teacher-only analytics (with extreme caution)

All changes must answer:

> What did real students do with this system  
> that we did not anticipate?

---

## What Codex Machina Will Not Become

Regardless of version:

- It will not rank students
- It will not optimize behavior through rewards
- It will not replace teacher judgment
- It will not coach writing in place of students
- It will not collapse thinking into metrics

Codex Machina exists to support **intellectual development**, not to measure it.

---

## Design North Star

> Writing is not the outcome of thinking.  
> Writing *is* thinking.

Every feature must serve that truth.
