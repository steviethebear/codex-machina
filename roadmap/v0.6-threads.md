# v0.6 Feature Spec — Threads

## Purpose

**Threads** are spaces where students **weave permanent notes into lines of thought**.

They allow students to explore structure, tension, and relationship among ideas
*without rewriting or finalizing them*. Threads support sense-making first and
formal writing later.

Threads are not drafts.
Threads are not essays.
Threads are **arrangements of thinking**.

---

## Core Concept

A Thread is a **weaving space**, not a document.

Students bring together existing permanent notes and arrange them to discover:
- arguments
- tensions
- gaps
- recurring ideas
- possible directions for formal writing

Writing happens later.  
Threads are where structure emerges.

---

## Student Experience

### Creating Threads
- Students can create multiple Threads.
- Each Thread has:
  - a title (interpretive, provisional)
  - an optional short description
- Threads are private to the student by default
  (visible to teachers).

---

### Weaving Notes
- Students drag **permanent notes** into a Thread.
- Notes can:
  - be reordered
  - grouped
  - nested under headings or labels
- A note may appear in **multiple Threads**.
- Threads do **not** contain new prose writing.

This reinforces:
> thinking by arrangement, not by rewriting.

---

### Visual Signals
- Subtle indicators show when notes placed together:
  - already link to one another
  - form a dense cluster in the graph
- These signals are informational only.
- No scoring, ranking, or optimization cues.

---

### Living Structures
- Threads are expected to:
  - change
  - break
  - be abandoned
- There is no “finished” state.

Students may:
- duplicate a Thread
- fork it into a new line of thought
- return later with more notes

Threads preserve **intellectual flexibility**.

---

## Relationship to the Knowledge Graph

- The **Graph** shows *what exists* and how ideas connect globally.
- **Threads** show *how a student interprets and organizes those ideas*.

Graph = structure that emerges  
Threads = structure that is chosen

Both coexist. Neither replaces the other.

---

## Teacher Experience

### Visibility
- Teachers can view all student Threads.
- Threads are readable but not editable by teachers.

---

### Commentary
- Teachers can comment on:
  - overall structure
  - placement of notes
  - missing connections
  - redundancies
- Comments focus on **thinking and organization**, not correctness.

Threads give teachers insight into *how students are preparing to write*.

---

## Export & Use for Writing

Threads support transition to formal writing:

- **v0.6.0 Export:**
  - Markdown (`.md` files with note content and structure)
- **Future Formats** (deferred to v1.x based on teacher feedback):
  - Plain text outline
  - PDF
- Used to write:
  - Living Codex essays (Books I–IV)
  - drafts created outside Codex Machina
  - later, in-system drafts (future version)

Threads bridge:
> notes → structure → writing

---

## Assessment Philosophy

- Threads are **not graded artifacts**.
- No points are awarded for creating or completing Threads.
- Threads may inform teacher feedback and conferences.
- Teachers assess **thinking**, not Thread polish.

---

## AI Role (Explicitly Limited)

AI does **not**:
- evaluate Threads
- suggest structure
- rank notes
- optimize arrangement

AI may:
- surface informational signals
  (e.g., “These notes are already linked”)

Threads remain a **human interpretive space**.

---

## Unlocking Threads

Threads are an **unlockable capability**, not a requirement.

They unlock when:
- sufficient permanent notes exist
- thinking has persisted across time
- arrangement would be meaningful rather than premature

Students are not told unlock conditions.

Unlock notification language is understated:
> “A new space for weaving ideas is now available.”

---

## Design Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

- No drafting inside Threads
- No rewriting notes inside Threads
- No AI-driven structure suggestions
- No scoring or ranking
- No “completion” state

Threads must always feel:
- exploratory
- provisional
- revisable by rearrangement, not rewriting

---

## Pedagogical Alignment

Threads embody the core idea of Codex Machina:

> Writing is not the outcome of thinking.  
> Writing *is* thinking.

Threads make that visible by showing:
- how ideas are chosen
- how they are placed
- how meaning is woven

They teach students that **structure is an act of interpretation**.

---

## Why Threads Matter

Without Threads:
- students jump too quickly from notes to essays
- structure feels imposed rather than discovered

With Threads:
- synthesis becomes visible
- arguments emerge organically
- writing begins *before* drafting

Threads are where thinking becomes shape.
